    "* UNION: show all rows returned from the queries, without duplicates\n",
    "* INTERSECT: show only rows that are common in the queries\n",
    "* EXCEPT: show only rows that are different in the queries\n",

    "* hide structure of data from users\n",
    "* hide data from users(different users use different views. e.g., allow someone to access employee table, but not salaries column)\n",

    "To create a view:\n",
