    "* A theoretical foundation for the relational model. \n",

    "* Last phase of logical design\n",
    "* Normalisation rules are designed to prevent data redundancy and prevent update anomalies\n",
    "* Normalisation is biased towards optimizing updates. It assumes non-key columns are updated frequently. Thus it can slow down *Selects* because of the need to join tables. Thus designers sometimes \"de-normalise\" some tables to improve performance\n",
    "* Every attribute must be functionally dependent on **\"The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "Design progresses in stages from 1NF via 3NF, possibly as far as 6NF. In this course we only cover 1NF to 3.5NF(Boyce-Codd NF). This is often sufficient in practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "To begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write in relational notation. List all the attributes that must be recorded, as one big relation\n",
    "2. Don't include anything that you can derive(e.g. total sales)\n",
    "3. Use parentheses \"()\" to indicate repeating groups\n",
    "4. Underline the primary key\n",

    "\n",
    "* R1 doesn't have a composite key, so it is already in 2NF\n",
    "\n",
    "* R2 is not in 2NF, because ProductDesc and UnitPrice are determined by ProductNo, which is part of the primary key. We need to create a new table from these fields\n",
