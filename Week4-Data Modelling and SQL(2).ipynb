    "Relational database doesn't directly support $M-M$, so we create an Associative Entity between the other $2$ entities. Each of these $2$ relationships is like any $1-M$ relationship\n",

    "Suppose each student will take more than one subject, and each subject will be taken by more than one student. Then the primary key from both tables can form the primary key for the associative entity, that is, studentId and SubjectCode. We can add attributes to the associative entity to record when the student took the subject and the result they got.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associative entity may participate in other relationships, in this case, a Ternary relationship. For example, the student needs the permission from a staff to enroll a subject.\n",
