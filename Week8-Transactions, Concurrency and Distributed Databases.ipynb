    "# Transactions & Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Example \"business transactions\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insert one row in *Order* table, then several in *OrderItem* table\n",
    "* Insert one row in supertype table, then one row in subtype table\n",
    "* Check amount < balance. If so, subtract from one row in bank account table, then add amount to another row\n",
    "* For all rows in *Customer* table, send out monthly statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Each requires several distinct database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction: A logical unit of work that must either be entirely completed or aborted(indivisible, atomic)\n",
    "\n",
    "DML statements are already atomic.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDBMS also allows for user-defined transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful transaction changes the database from one consistent state to another.(One in which all data integrity constraints are satisfied)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions solve TWO problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* users need the ability to define a unit of work\n",
    "* concurrent access to data by >1 user or program\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: Unit of work\n",
    "\n",
    "Single DML or DDL command(implicit transaction):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update $700$ records, but database crashes after $200$ records processed\n",
    "* Restart server: you will find no changes to any records\n",
    "* Changes are \"all or none\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple statements (user-defined transaction)\n",
    "* START TRANSACTION; (or, 'BEGIN')\n",
    "    * SQL statement;\n",
    "    * SQL statement;\n",
    "    * SQL statement;\n",
    "    * ...\n",
    "* COMMIT; (commits the whole transaction)\n",
    "    * Or ROLLBACK (to undo everything)\n",
    "    \n",
    "SQL keywords: **begin**, **commit**, **rollback**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction consists of several SQL statements, embedded within a larger application program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction needs to be treated as an indivisible unit of work. \"Indivisible\" means that either the whole job gets done, or none gets done: If an error occurs, we don't leave the database with the job half done, in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an error: \n",
    "* Any SQL statements already completed must be reversed\n",
    "* Show an error message to the user\n",
    "* When ready, the user can try the transaction again\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Properties(ACID):\n",
    "* Atomicity: A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible, logical unit of work. All operations in a transaction must be completed; if not, then the transaction is aborted.\n",
    "* Consistency: Constraints that hold before a transaction must also hold after it. Multiple users accessing the same data see the same value.\n",
    "* Isolation: Changes made during execution of a transaction cannot be seen by other transactions until this one is completed.\n",
    "* Durability: When a transaction is complete, the changes made to the database are permanent, even if the system fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Concurrent access\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent execution of DML against a shared database; Note that the sharing of data among multiple users is where much of the benefit of databases derives - users communicate and collaborate via shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could go wrong?\n",
    "* Lost updates\n",
    "* Uncommitted data\n",
    "* Inconsistent retrievals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lost Update problem\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img60.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncommitted Data\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img61.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Inconsistent Retrieval problem\n",
    "\n",
    "It occurs when one transaction calculates some aggregate functions over a set of data, while other transaction are updating the data. Some data may be read after they are changed and some before they are changed, yielding inconsistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serializability\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions ideally are \"serializable\"\n",
    "* Multiple, concurrent transactions appear as if they were executed one after another\n",
    "* Ensures that the concurrent execution of several transactions yields consistent results\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img62.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "But true serial execution (i.e. no concurrency) is very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency control methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve efficient execution of transactions, the DBMS creates a schedule of read and write operations for concurrent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaves the execution of operations, based on concurrency control algorithms such as locking and time stamping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods of concurrency control:\n",
    "* Locking is the main method used\n",
    "* Alternate methods: Time Stamping & Optimistic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locking\n",
    "\n",
    "Guarantees exclusive use of a data item to a current transaction\n",
    "* T1 acquires a lock prior to data access; the lock is released when the transaction is complete\n",
    "* T2 does not have access to data item currently being used by T1\n",
    "* T2 has to wait until T1 releases the lock\n",
    "\n",
    "Required to prevent another transaction from reading inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lock manager: Responsible for assigning and policing the locks used by the transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lock Granularity: options\n",
    "\n",
    "Database-level lock\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entire database is locked\n",
    "* Good for batch processing but unsuitable for multi-user DBMSs\n",
    "* T1 and T2 can not access the same database concurrently even if they use different tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Table-level lock\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entire table is locked - as above but not quite as bad\n",
    "* T1 and T2 can access the same database concurrently as long as they use different tables\n",
    "* Can cause bottlenecks, even if transactions want to access different parts of the table and would not interfere with each other\n",
    "* Not suitable for highly multi-user DBMSs\n",
    "\n",
    "Page-level lock\n",
    "\n",
    "* An entire disk page is locked (a table can span several pages and each page can contain several rows of one or more tables)\n",
    "* Not commonly used now\n",
    "\n",
    "Row-level lock\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows concurrent transactions to access different rows of the same table, even if the rows are located on the same page\n",
    "* Improves data availability but with high overhead (each row has a lock that must be read and written to)\n",
    "* Currently the most popular approach(MySQL, Oracle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Field-level lock\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows concurrent transactions to access the same row, as long as they access different attributes within that row\n",
    "* Most flexible lock but requires an extremely high level of overhead\n",
    "* Not commonly used\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary locks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* has only two states: locked(1) or unlocked(0)\n",
    "* eliminates \"Lost Update\" problem (the lock is not released until the statement is completed)\n",
    "* considered too restrictive to yield optimal concurrency, as it locks even for two READs (when no update is being done)\n",
    "* The alternative is to allow both Exclusive and Shared locks(often called Write and Read locks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusive lock\n",
    "* access is reserved for the transaction that locked the object\n",
    "* must be used when transaction intends to WRITE\n",
    "* granted if and only if no other locks are held on the data item\n",
    "* in MySQL: \"select ... for update\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared lock\n",
    "* other transactions are also granted Read access\n",
    "* issued when a transaction wants to READ data, and no Exclusive lock is held on that data item\n",
    "* in MySQL: \"select ... lock in share mode\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deadlock\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition that occurs when transactions wait for each other to unlock data\n",
    "* T1 locks data item X, then wants Y\n",
    "* T2 locks data item Y, then wants X\n",
    "* each waits to get a data item which the other transaction is already holding\n",
    "* could wait forever if not dealt with\n",
    "\n",
    "It only happens with exclusive locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock are dealt with by:\n",
    "* prevention\n",
    "* detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative concurrency control methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamp\n",
    "* Assigns a global unique timestamp to each transaction\n",
    "* Each data item accessed by the transaction gets the timestamp\n",
    "* Thus for every data item, the DBMS knows which transaction performed the last read or write on it\n",
    "* When a transaction wants to read or write, the DBMS compares its timestamp with the timestamps already attached to the item and decides whether to allow access\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimistic\n",
    "* Based on the assumption that the majority of database operations do not conflict\n",
    "* Transaction is executed without restrictions or checking\n",
    "* Then when it is ready to commit, the DBMS checks whether any of the data it read has been altered - if so, rollback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to restore database to a previous consistent state. If transaction cannot be completed, it must be aborted and any changes rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this, DBMS tracks all updates to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transaction log contains:\n",
    "* a record for the beginning of the transaction\n",
    "* for each SQL statement\n",
    "    * operation being performed (update, delete, insert)\n",
    "    * objects affected by the transaction\n",
    "    * \"before\" and \"after\" values for updated fields\n",
    "    * pointers to previous and next transaction log entries\n",
    "* the ending (COMMIT) of the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides the ability to restore a corrupted database. If a system failure occurs, the DBMS will examine the log for all uncommitted or incomplete transactions and it will restore the database to a previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Distributed Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img63.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed database: a single logical database spread across multiple computers in multiple locations that are connected by a data communication link. It appears to users as though it is one database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized database: a collection of independent databases which are not networked together as one logical database. It appears to users as though many databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed DBMS Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good fit for geographically distributed organizations/users\n",
    "* Data located near site with with greatest demand\n",
    "* Faster data access (to local data)\n",
    "* Faster data processing (workload spread out across many machines)\n",
    "* Allows modular growth (add new servers as load increases)\n",
    "* Increased reliability and availability (less danger of single-point failure)\n",
    "* Supports database recovery (data is replicated across multiple sites)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity of management and control (db or application must stitch together data across sites)\n",
    "* Data integrity (additional exposure to improper updating)\n",
    "* Security (many server sites leads to higher chance of breach)\n",
    "* Lack of standards (different DBMS vendors use different protocols)\n",
    "* Increased training costs (more complex IT infrastructure)\n",
    "* Increased storage requirements (if there are multiple copies of data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives and Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Location transparency: \n",
    "* A user(or program) needn't know where particular data are stored\n",
    "* Requests to retrieve or update data from any site are automatically forwarded by the system to the site or sites related to the processing request\n",
    "* All data in the network appears as a single logical database stored at one site to the users\n",
    "* A single query can join data from tables in multiple sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Local autonomy: \n",
    "* A node can continue to function for local users if connectivity to the network is lost\n",
    "* Users can administer their local database\n",
    "    * control local data\n",
    "    * administer security\n",
    "    * log transactions\n",
    "    * recover when local failures occur\n",
    "    * provide full access to local data\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-offs:\n",
    "* Availability vs Consistency\n",
    "* Synchronous vs Asynchronous updates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution options\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data replication(data copied across sites)\n",
    "* Horizontal partitioning: table rows distributed across sites\n",
    "* Vertical partitioning: table columns distributed across sites\n",
    "* Combination of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replication advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* High reliability due to redundant copies\n",
    "* Fast access to local data\n",
    "* May avoid complicated distributed integrity routines if replicated data is refreshed at scheduled intervals\n",
    "* Decouples nodes, transactions proceed even if some nodes are down\n",
    "* Reduced network traffic at prime time if updates can be delayed\n",
    "* This is currently popular as a way of achieving high availability for global systems. Most NoSQL databases offer replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replication disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Need more storage space\n",
    "* Integrity: can retrieve incorrect data if updates have not arrived\n",
    "* Takes time for update operations\n",
    "    * high tolerance for out-of-date data may be required\n",
    "    * updates may cause performance problems for busy nodes\n",
    "* Network communication capabilities, update place heavy demand on telecommunications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous updates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is continuously kept up to date, users anywhere can access data and get the same answer\n",
    "* If any copy of a data item is updated anywhere on the network, the same update is immediately applied to all other copies or it is aborted\n",
    "* Ensures data integrity and minimizes the complexity of knowing where the most recent copy of data is located.\n",
    "* Can result in slow response time and high network usage. The DDBMS spends considerable time checking that an update is accurately and completely propagated across the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous updates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some delay in propagating data updates to remote databases. Some degree of at least temporary inconsistency is tolerated. May be ok if it's temporary and well managed\n",
    "* Tends to have acceptable response time. Updates happen locally and data replicas are synchronized in batches and predetermined intervals\n",
    "* May be more complex to plan and design. Need to ensure the right level of data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "* Suits some information systems more than others. Compare commerce/finance systems with social media\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Different rows of a table at different sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiency: data stored close to where it is used\n",
    "* Better performance: local access optimization\n",
    "* Security: only relevant data is stored locally\n",
    "* Ease of query: unions across partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inconsistent access speed: accessing data across partitions\n",
    "* backup vulnerability: no data replication\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img64.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertical partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Different columns of a table at different sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and disadvantages are the same as for horizontal partitioning except combining data across partitions is more difficult because it requires joins(instead of unions).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img65.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing 5 configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centralized database, distributed access: DB is at one location, and accessed from everywhere.\n",
    "* Replication with periodic snapshot update: many locations, each data copy updated periodically\n",
    "* Replication with near real-time synchronization of updates: many locations, each data copy updated in near real time\n",
    "* Partitioned, integrated, one logical database: data partitioned across at many sites, within a logical database, and a single DBMS\n",
    "* Partitioned, independent, nonintegrated segments: data partitioned across many sites, multiple DBMS, multiple computers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Centralized\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliability: poor, highly dependent on central server\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expandability: poor, limitations are barriers to performance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Communication overhead: very high, traffic from all locations goes to one site\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manageability: very good, one monolithic site requires little coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data consistency: excellent, all users always access the same data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Replicated with Snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliability: good, redundancy and tolerated delays\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expandability: very good, cheap to add new servers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Communications Overhead: low to medium, not constant, but periodic snapshots can cause bursts of network traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manageability: very good, each copy is like every other one\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data consistency: medium, fine as long as update delays are tolerable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synchronized Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliability: excellent, redundancy and minimal delays\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expandability: very good, cost of additional copies may be low and synchronization work only linear\n",
    "\n",
    "* Communications Overhead: medium, messages are constant, but some delays are tolerated\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manageability: medium, collisions add some complexity to manageability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Consistency: very good, close to precise consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrated Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliability: good, effective use of partitioning and redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expandability: very good, new nodes get only data they need without changes in overall database design\n",
    "\n",
    "* Communications Overhead: low to medium, most queries are local, but queries that require data from multiple sites can cause a temporary load\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manageability: difficult, especially difficult for queries that need data from distributed tables, and updates must be tightly coordinated\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Consistency: very poor, considerable effort, and inconsistencies not tolerated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decentralized, Independent Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliability: good, depends on only local database availability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expandability: good, new sites independent of existing ones\n",
    "\n",
    "* Communications Overhead: low, little if any need to pass data or queries across the network (if one exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manageability: very good, easy for each site, until there is a need to share data across sites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Consistency: low, no guarantees of consistency, in fact, pretty sure of inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions of a distributed DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Locate data with a distributed data dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine location from which to retrieve data and process query components\n",
    "\n",
    "* DBMS translation between nodes with different local DBMSs(using middleware)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data consistency(via multiphase commit protocols)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Global primary key control\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security, concurrency, query optimization, failure recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12 Commandments for Distributed Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Local Site Independence: Each local site can act as an independent, autonomous, centralized DBMS. Each site is responsible for security, concurrency, control, backup and recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Central Site Independence: No site in the network relies on a central site or any other site. All sites have the same capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Failure Independence: The system is not affected by node failures. The system is in continuous operation even in the case of a node failure or an expansion of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Location Transparency: The user does not need to know the location of the data to retrieve those data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fragmentation Transparency: Data fragmentation is transparent to the user, who sees only one logical database. The user does not need to know the name of the database fragments to retrieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replication Transparency: The user sees only one logical database. The DDBMS transparently selects the database fragment(s) to access. To the user, the DDBMS manages all fragments transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributed Query Processing: A distributed query may be executed at several different sites. Query optimisation is performed transparently by the DDBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributed Transaction Processing: A transaction may update data at several different sites, and the transaction is executed transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hardware Independence: The system must run on any hardware platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operating System Independence: The system must run on any operating system platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Network Independence: The system must run on any network platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Database Independence: The system must support any vendor's database product."
