    "\n",
    "SQL is declarative, intuitive, versatile, but\n",
    "* cannot express all possible queries in SQL\n",
    "* need to enforce business rules beyond domain/ref integrity\n",
    "* need procedural constructs such as loops and decisions\n",
    "* need a user interface that is both friendly and constraining\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of business logic:\n",
    "* Check name and password. If good, login, if bad, error message\n",
    "* Insert one row in Order table, then several in OrderItem table\n",
    "* Insert one row in supertype table, then one row in subtype table\n",
    "* Check amount < balance. If so, subtract amount from one row in bank account table, then add amount to another row\n",
    "* For all rows in Customer table, send out monthly statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming languages can do:\n",
    "* Sequence(several steps performed in order)\n",
    "* Iteration(loops)\n",
    "* Control flow(conditions, decisions)\n",
    "* User interface(accept input and present output for users)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is specialized for low-level data access\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer places an order:\n",
    "* Accept inputs from user(e.g. via web form)\n",
    "* Insert row into Order table\n",
    "* Repeat for each product ordered:\n",
    "    * Check Product table shows sufficient quantity in stock. If so:\n",
    "        * Insert one row into OrderItem table\n",
    "        * Change Product table in-stock, Customer table amount-owing\n",
    "* If no errors encountered, end successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to combine data manipulation with the ability to handle sequence, iteration, decision. Different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Embedded SQL\"(Old-fashioned)\n",
    "    * \"host language\" = C, Fortran, Cobol, Java etc\n",
    "    * SQL embedded in code is interpreted and replaced with library calls\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Dynamic SQL\"(Common today)\n",
    "    * Host language sends SQL to DBMS via middleware e.g. ODBC\n",
    "    * Data is passed back to program as record-set\n",
    "    * Host language can handle business and presentation logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stored Procedures, Triggers\n",
    "    * Procedural code is stored and executed in the DBMS\n",
    "    * Enforce business logic within the database\n",
    "    * In SQL-92 standard, but implemented differently in different DBMS(Procedural code for Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft are different)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example stored procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. accept person details as inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. check whether the person is already in the database\n",
    "\n",
    "3. if yes, return error\n",
    "\n",
    "4. if no, add to database\n",

    "\n",
    "* Mainframe/dumb terminal(1-tier)\n",
    "    * One large computer handles all logic\n",
    "    * Problems: doesn't scale up\n",
    "* Client-Server architecture\n",
    "    * 2-tier: presentation, business logic is handled in client application\n",
    "    * 3-tier: separation of Presentation, Processing and Storage logic\n",
    "* Web architecture\n",
    "    * a particular form of 3 or 4 tier\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"img/img57.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages for 2-Tier\n",
    "* Clients and server share processing load(the presentation and business logic are handled by PC)\n",
    "* Good data integrity since data is all processed centrally\n",
    "* Stored procedures allow some business rules to be implemented on the database server\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages for 2-Tier\n",
    "* Presentation, business logic, data model are intertwined at client\n",
    "* If DB schema changes, all clients break(such as adding a columns to a table)\n",
    "* Updates need to be deployed to all clients\n",
    "* DB connection for every client, thus difficult to scale\n",
    "* Difficult to implement beyond the organization(to customers)\n",

    "### 3-Tier architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Client program & Application server & Database server\n",
    "\n",
    "Presentation logic: Client handles interface, thinner clients, limited or no data storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Business logic: Application server deals with business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage logic: Database server deals with data persistence and access\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of 3-Tier:\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "* Technological flexibility(can change business logic easily, no impact on other parts)\n",
    "* Can swap out any single component fairly easily(transfer from MySQL to Oracle)\n",
    "* Long-term cost reduction\n",
    "* Improved security - customer machine does presentation only\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of 3-Tier:\n",
    "* High short-term costs\n",
    "* Tools and training\n",
    "* Complex to design\n",
    "* Variable standards(between different vendors)\n",
    "\n",

    "Pros:\n",
    "* Everyone has a browser\n",
    "* No need for install and maintain client software\n",
    "* HTML and HTTP are simple standards, widely supported\n",
    "* Opens up the possibility of global access to database\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "* Even more complexity in the middle-tier\n",
    "* Simple standards = hard to make complex application\n",
    "* Global access = potential security nightmare\n",
